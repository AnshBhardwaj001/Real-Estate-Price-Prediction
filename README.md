# Real-Estate-Price-Prediction
This project focuses on developing a real estate price prediction website. The process begins by building a predictive model using sklearn and linear regression, leveraging the Bangalore home prices dataset from Kaggle. A Python Flask server is then created to serve HTTP requests using the saved model. The final component is a user-friendly website built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, enabling users to input home details such as square footage and bedrooms to retrieve the predicted price. This project incorporates key data science concepts including data loading and cleaning, outlier detection and removal, feature engineering, dimensionality reduction, hyperparameter tuning with gridsearchcv, and k-fold cross-validation.

Technologies and Tools Used:

1. Python for programming Numpy and Pandas for data cleaning
2. Matplotlib for data visualization
3. Sklearn for model building
4. Jupyter Notebook, Visual Studio Code, and PyCharm as IDEs
5. Python Flask for the HTTP server
6. HTML/CSS/JavaScript for the user interface
